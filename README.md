<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


### Why?
For expanding my knowledge, with practical & a hands-on approach.
### Stack
#### Developer experience
- 🧰 [Dagger GoSDK](https://docs.dagger.io/sdk/go/959738/get-started)
- 🧰 [TaskFile](https://taskfile.dev/#/) — for the automation of the tasks.
#### Technologies
- ⚡️ [Deno](https://deno.land/) — for the runtime.
- ⚡️ [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/)
- ⚡️ [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)

## ⚡️ Quick start
In order to quickly boostrap this project, ensure that you have installed [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation) and [Deno](https://deno.land/).
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the following command to start the application:
```bash
task start
```

For install some utilities, and ensure the task scripts will work smoothly, you can run the following command:
```bash
task setup
```
The above command will take care of install/upgrade required binaries if applicable. This assumes that you are running this project from a Mac OS machine, using `brew` as the package manager.
